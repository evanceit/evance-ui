# EvGrid

Evance UI comes with a 12-point grid system, built using flexbox.

The grid is used to create specific layouts within an application’s content.
It contains 5 types of media breakpoints that are used for targeting specific
screen sizes or orientations: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg` and `xl`.

## EvContainer
`<ev-container>`

## EvLayout
`<ev-layout>`

## EvBlock
`<ev-layout>`


## EvSpacer
`<ev-spacer />` is a spacing component used to distribute the remaining width  between a parent's child components.
When placing a single `ev-spacer` before or after child components, the components will push to the
right and left of its container. When more than one `ev-spacer`'s are used between multiple components,
the remaining width is evenly distributed between each spacer.
