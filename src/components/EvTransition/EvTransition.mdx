# EvTransition

`<ev-transition>` is a functional component, which may be used to accept transition props.
It accepts all arguments that the default `<transition>` component accepts built into Vue,
but it also allows transition components to be supplied.

```html
<ev-transition>
    Default slot
</ev-transition>
```
