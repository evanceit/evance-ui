# EvForm
The `ev-form` component is responsible for managing form state and must encapsulate your form fields.

All Evance UI form components are designed to integrate with `<ev-form>`. Instead of using the standard
`v-model`, each field's `name` property is used to link the field with the form `data`.

<Canvas of={EvFormStories.Primary} />
<Controls />

## Reactive form data

In the example below the `<ev-textfield>` maps `user[email]` to `data.user.email`.

The following `name` attributes are compatible, however we recommend keeping your naming convention consistent with
server-side validation responses for easier implementations.

- `user[email]` - FormData-style
- `user.email` - JSON-style

This syncs modifications made in the textfield with your data object.

```html
<script setup lang="ts">

const data = reactive({
    user: {
        email: null
    }
});

</script>

<template>
    <ev-form :data="data">

        <ev-textfield label="Email" name="user[email]" />

    </ev-form>
</template>
```

## Handling server-side validation

Whilst client-side validation offers an immediate response,
it's always important to be able to handle validation errors from server responses. To help facilitate this the
validation response from the `SubmitEventPromise` includes an `addErrors` method, which allows you to feed errors
from your server response into the form and its fields. Again, this is mapped based on the `name` attribute of your fields.

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
async function onSubmit($event) {
     const validation = await $event;
     if (validation.valid) {

         // Perform a server request if client-side validation is unsuccessful

         fetch(url, { method: 'POST' })
         .then(response => {

            // If the response is unsuccessful add appropriate errors
            // to the validation response

            validation.addErrors([
                 {
                     name: "user[name]",
                     message: "Error from server",
                 }
             ]);


         })
     }
 }
</script>
<template>
    <ev-form @submit.prevent="onSubmit">

        <ev-textfield label="Email" name="user[email]" />

    </ev-form>
</template>
```
