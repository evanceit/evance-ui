# EvNumberField

The `<ev-number-field>` or `<EvNumberField>` binds the `modelValue` as a number, but renders as a string within
the input field.

The field permits basic arithmetic operations. For example, you may enter the `100/2` and press Enter to calculate
the value as `50`.

When using the number field in `mode="currency"` with an accompanying `currency` (e.g. 'GBP') the field will remove
currency formatting on focus.
