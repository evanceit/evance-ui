# Internationalization

This is a work in progress - currently testing Translator reactivity.

<Canvas of={InternationalizationStories.Primary} />

## Translations

Translator supports name based variable replacement, cardinal and ordinal pluralization.

Note, pluralization only supports a single variable.

### String Templates

String templates are name based:

```javascript
{
    greeting: "Hello { name }"
}
```

```javascript
{{ t('greeting', { name: 'Kitty' }) }}
```

```
Hello Kitty
```

## Pluralization

Languages use different patterns for expressing both plural numbers of items (cardinal numbers)
and for expressing the order of items (ordinal numbers).

Your Language Pack may include the full range of pluralization rule properties:

- ```zero```
- ```one```
- ```two```
- ```few```
- ```many```
- ```other``` - the "general" plural form, also used if the language only has one form
- ```ordinal``` - an optional boolean indicating whether the pluralization needs to be ordinal

### Cardinal

Cardinal is the default type of pluralization.

```javascript
{
    months: {
        one: "{ value } month",
        other: "{ value } months"
    }
}
```

```javascript
{{ t('months', { value: 1 }) }}
```

```
1 month
```


### Ordinal

Ordinal pluralization needs to be represented using an ```ordinal: true``` property on your pluralization rule.

```javascript
{
    place: {
        one: "{ value }st",
        two: "{ value }nd",
        few: "{ value }rd",
        other: "{ value }th",
        ordinal: true
    }
}
```

```javascript
{{ t('place', { value: 23 }) }}
```

```
23rd
```
